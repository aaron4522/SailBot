# Challenge Goal:
    - To demonstrate the boat's durability and capability to sail some distance
    
    # Description:
        - The boats will sail around 4 buoys (passing within 10 m inside of buoy is OK) for up to 7 hours
    
    # Scoring:
        - 10 pts max
        - 1 pt for each 1NM lap completed autonomously (1/2 pt/lap if RC is used at any point during the lap*)
        - An additional 1pt for each continuous (no pit-stop) hr sailed; up to 6 pts
        - At least one lap must be completed to earn points
        - All boats must start each subsequent lap at the Start line following a pit stop or support boat rescue. (*No penalty for momentary RC to avoid collisions.)
    
    # Assumptions: (based on guidelines)
        - left of start direction is upstream
    
    # Strategy:
        - TODO write psuedocode about how this event logic works
