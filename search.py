# Challenge	Goal:
    - To demonstrate the boatâ€™s ability to autonomously locate an object
    
    # Description:
        - An orange buoy will be placed somewhere within 100 m of a reference position
        - The boat must locate, touch, and signal* such within 10 minutes of entering the search area
        - RC is not allowed after entering the search area
        - 'Signal' means white strobe on boat and/or signal to a shore station and either turn into wind or assume station-keeping mode
    
    # Scoring:
        - 15 pts max
        - 12 pts for touching (w/o signal)
        - 9 pts for passing within 1m
        - 6 pts for performing a search pattern (creeping line, expanding square, direct tracking to buoy, etc)
    
    # Assumptions: (based on guidelines)
        - 
        
    # Strategy:
        - Define a Z-shaped search pattern
        - Travel along the search path while taking panoramas to detect buoys
            - If heatmap has a high confidence point of interest:
                - Save current position and divert course towards buoy
                - Focus camera on expected buoy position and take pictures
                - If that buoy still be a buoy:
                    - Keep moving towards buoy and ram that shit
                - Else:
                    - False positive (hopefully VERY rare)! PANIC! Return to previous search course
                    - Blacklist location (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
                    
            - If x% buoy match:
                - Ignore if estimated position is outside of bounds + buffer
                - Add to heatmap
